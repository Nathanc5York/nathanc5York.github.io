            <h2>Gasoline vs. Electricity</h2>
            <p>A study<sup><a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars">[1]</a></sup> in 2019 compared the CO2 emissions gasoline and electric cars produce.</p>
            <p>They studied the different models that car manufacturers produced and found that over a car's lifetime, the electric car produced 57% less CO2 per mile.</p>
            <p>They even found that in fossil fuel powered states, an electric car still beat out a gasoline car in terms of CO2 sustainability.</p>
